   abstract = {This paper describes the design of an inductive interface for an electric vehicle (EV) charging system based on a coaxial winding power transformer. The inductive interface is a separable transformer providing a means to 'plug-in' an EV without the need for metal-to-metal contact of exposed conductors. The proposed design is 'universal' in that dimensions can be selected which will accommodate more than an order of magnitude range of power ratings without imposing significant performance degradation. Interface geometry standardization and the configuration of the core and windings are shown to have important effects on the demands on the user, the EV infrastructure, the distribution of stationary and mobile weight, and the power electronic converter requirements. Design methodology for the proposed approach is summarized and experimental results of a laboratory prototype are presented to verify the design theory.},

   abstract = {Electrified transportation will help to reduce green-house gas emissions and increasing petrol prices. Electrified transportation demands that a wide variety of charging networks be set up, in a user-friendly environment, to encourage adoption. Wireless electric vehicle charging systems (WEVCS) can be a potential alternative technology to charge the electric vehicles (EVs) without any plug-in problems. This paper outlines the current available wireless power transfer technology for EVs. In addition, it also includes wireless transformer structures with a variety of ferrite shapes, which have been researched. WEVCS are associated with health and safety issues, which have been discussed with the current development in international standards. Two major applications, static and dynamic WEVCS, are explained, and up-to-date progress with features from research laboratories, universities, and industries are recorded. Moreover, future upcoming concepts-based WEVCS, such as “vehicle-to-grid (V2G)” and “in-wheel” wireless charging systems (WCS) are reviewed and examined, with qualitative comparisons with other existing technology.},

@article{Topal2018,
   abstract = {As across the world, in Turkey, several studies have been carried out by local government to use sustainable and 100% zero-emission public transport following increased public awareness. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) due to transportation systems in the world make it necessary to establish &ldquo;zero-emission sustainable transportation systems&rdquo; in Turkey. In this study, an economic analysis based on actual field data is presented for Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel General Management (IETT) to seek the suitability of an electric bus concept for Istanbul conditions. For this purpose, a dynamic model based on the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) from well to wheel has been proposed for the three groups of transportation, namely diesel, CNG (compressed natural gas) and electric buses. The data source used in the proposed approach is created by performing actual field performance tests for diesel, CNG and electric buses under real Istanbul road, time, and trip conditions. Afterwards, the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Payback Period (PB) methods considering TCO values and updated unit prices are carried out for the investment versus profitability analyses to compare the different public bus concepts. The results show that the electric bus concept with a charging station depot achieving sustainable and zero-emission goals will be the driving force to advance the electric bus concept for Istanbul Public Transport.},

@article{Chen2018,
   abstract = {This study investigates the cost competitiveness of different types of charging infrastructure, including charging stations, charging lanes (via charging-while-driving technologies) and battery swapping stations, in support of an electric public transit system. To this end, we first establish mathematical models to investigate the optimal deployment of various charging facilities along the transit line and determine the optimal size of the electric bus fleet, as well as their batteries, to minimize total infrastructure and fleet costs while guaranteeing service frequency and satisfying the charging needs of the transit system. We then conduct an empirical analysis utilizing available real-world data. The results suggest that: (1) the service frequency, circulation length, and operating speed of a transit system may have a great impact on the cost competitiveness of different charging infrastructure; (2) charging lanes enabled by currently available inductive wireless charging technology are cost competitive for most of the existing bus rapid transit corridors; (3) swapping stations can yield a lower total cost than charging lanes and charging stations for transit systems with high operating speed and low service frequency; (4) charging stations are cost competitive only for transit systems with very low service frequency and short circulation; and (5) the key to making charging lanes more competitive for transit systems with low service frequency and high operating speed is to reduce their unit-length construction cost or enhance their charging power.},

   abstract = {In this article, we review the worldwide developments of battery-electric buses (a) from medium-sized vehicles (e.g., 6.7 m) to heavy-duty vehicles (e.g., 11 m), and (b) from the slow-charging mode (e.g., 6 hours) to the fast-charging mode (e.g., 10 minutes). We also review the worldwide operations of battery-electric buses (a) from 1907 in London, England, the early 1980s in Denver, Colorado, and the early 1990s in Santa Barbara, California, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, to various international cities now, and (b) from less than 20 vehicles in a transit agency to more than 1,000 vehicles. We summarize the experiences and lessons learned from real-world operations. We examine key technical specifications that are critical to the operations of electric bus systems, in particular the operational distance and charging time. Due to a limited operational range of battery-electric buses, three range remedy methods have been proposed: (a) regular (slow) battery charging with backup vehicles equipped with fully charged batteries; (2) battery swapping; and (3) fast opportunity charging during the layover period. We conduct a qualitative analysis on the strengths and weaknesses of each range remedy method. We also analyze the vehicle cost, energy cost, and emissions of transit buses powered by different sources, and examine potential impacts of fast-charging electric buses on the electric grid.},

   abstract = {The innovations in battery technologies facilitate worldwide bus electrification, which can conserve energy and reduce emissions. This paper studies the long-term bus electrification that simultaneously optimizes the charging infrastructure deployment and bus fleet transition. The seasonal differences associated with battery capacities, bus lines, and bus timetables are considered. The studied problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation, in which the detailed charging schedules are determined to give the charging location and charging time. The objective minimizes both the cost and emissions. The proposed formulation is tested on a real-world case study. The computational results indicate that replacing DPBs with BEBs can save 17.8% of total cost and decrease 39.3% of carbon dioxide emission. Compared with designing a plan for each period separately, implementing long-term bus electrification can save 13.5% of total cost and 21.7% of operational cost. Moreover, the benefits of implementing long-term bus electrification are more remarkable when the planning horizon is longer.},
