   abstract = {This paper describes the design of an inductive interface for an electric vehicle (EV) charging system based on a coaxial winding power transformer. The inductive interface is a separable transformer providing a means to 'plug-in' an EV without the need for metal-to-metal contact of exposed conductors. The proposed design is 'universal' in that dimensions can be selected which will accommodate more than an order of magnitude range of power ratings without imposing significant performance degradation. Interface geometry standardization and the configuration of the core and windings are shown to have important effects on the demands on the user, the EV infrastructure, the distribution of stationary and mobile weight, and the power electronic converter requirements. Design methodology for the proposed approach is summarized and experimental results of a laboratory prototype are presented to verify the design theory.},

@article{Panchal2018,
   abstract = {Electrified transportation will help to reduce green-house gas emissions and increasing petrol prices. Electrified transportation demands that a wide variety of charging networks be set up, in a user-friendly environment, to encourage adoption. Wireless electric vehicle charging systems (WEVCS) can be a potential alternative technology to charge the electric vehicles (EVs) without any plug-in problems. This paper outlines the current available wireless power transfer technology for EVs. In addition, it also includes wireless transformer structures with a variety of ferrite shapes, which have been researched. WEVCS are associated with health and safety issues, which have been discussed with the current development in international standards. Two major applications, static and dynamic WEVCS, are explained, and up-to-date progress with features from research laboratories, universities, and industries are recorded. Moreover, future upcoming concepts-based WEVCS, such as “vehicle-to-grid (V2G)” and “in-wheel” wireless charging systems (WCS) are reviewed and examined, with qualitative comparisons with other existing technology.},
