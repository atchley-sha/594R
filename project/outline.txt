Recently, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant public awareness and various levels of support. (compare ev and ice)

However, EVs are not always universally superior to ICE vehicles. (charging)

Another major consideration is the source of electricity used to power EVs. (emissions, ice vs electric, ultimately electric = *)

This paper, however, does not attempt to compare vehicle types based on emissions. (takes electrification as given, applies to UVX)

BACKGROUND

Any transit agency operating a bus network will need to take into account several considerations. (addt'l for ev buses)

Both electric and fuel-powered vehicles have limited range, but it is generally much faster to add fuel than to recharge a battery. Because of this, charging considerations become paramount in any deployment of EV buses. Several charging options exist...



UVX Case Study

The UVX is a bus rapid transit service operated by UTA and running through Provo and Orem, Utah. (info)

To make as close of a comparison as possible, I used the New Flyer XE 60 as the electric bus model to base my calculations. This model....

I compared these vehicles in several scenarios. 

    COSTS

The costs I used in my calculations are given in Table XXX. (estimates)
-lifespans



RESULTS

- overhead/plugin about the same
- site charging > lanes (for UVX)
- economically viable



LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

This analysis shows that the adoption of BE buses is economically viable, even when non-EV buses are already in service. (evidenced as well by agencies adopting ev buses, UTA as well)

However, several significant limitations apply to this research.
-variable costs
-estimates
-only UVX

Conclude that even with these limitations, transit agencies should look at BE buses. Also emissions.
